SCIENCE AND EXPERIMENTATION

Scientific inquiry
While “science” is a word commonly used in our culture, in popular use it is rarely spoken
of as a philosophy. By identifying science as a philosophy we are taking an epistemic view,
one focusing on how knowledge is acquired.
At its core, science is a mode of inquiry: a way of acquiring new knowledge about the
world around us and a strategy for understanding the inner workings of elements in that
world. Scientists believe that if we follow the principles of this philosophy we will continue
to expand our knowledge about how things work in the world around us. This systematic
approach is called the “scientific method.”

There are two key steps in the scientific method:
 **Hypothesis building through reflective observation.
 Hypothesis testing through experimentation.
 
A “hypothesis” is a question or proposed explanation made on the basis of limited
evidence and used as a starting point for experimentation. Experimentation is commonly
equated with science—rightly so, because hypotheses evaluated on the basis of evidence
generated through experiments. Experimentation, however, isn’t the whole story.
Science—including the development and testing of new hypotheses—is also a creative
endeavor.


Scientific discovery builds on what is already known. Even the most accomplished
scientists initially approach a problem by learning what is already known. Armed with
that information, they then apply their own creativity to form new hypotheses about
something they have observed, and design experiments to test those hypotheses. They
also communicate their results publicly so that others can benefit from their work and
have the opportunity to challenge conclusions. In this way, science builds on itself.
The foundational knowledge you learn in science classes prepares you to develop and test
hypotheses and to make new discoveries of your own. While a good memory may help
you pass a science classes, you will absorb a body of knowledge more effectively when you
learn how facts fit and work together in systems rather than learning through the brute
force of memorization.
In this section we work from the point of view that science is a way of acquiring
knowledge—a mode of inquiry—and that this mode of inquiry follows a process called the
scientific method. Those who follow the philosophy of science:
• Use it to understand how the natural world works.
• Start by learning what is already known.
• Carefully observe the subjects of their scientific inquiry and look for details about
form, function, and interaction with the environment.
• Develop hypotheses about the inner workings of natural phenomena not yet
understood.
• Test their hypotheses by making observations, conducting experiments and
collecting and evaluating evidence.
• Communicate with others about their hypotheses, experiments, and the outcomes

of their studies so that others can repeat, validate, and build upon their work.
Although science is typically used to understand how the natural world works, it is also
regularly applied to the development of new technologies that are based on these natural
phenomena and to the solving of problems associated with the natural world.


Types of experiments
The types of experimentation we will cover are:
• Demonstration
• Evaluation
• Exploration
• Discovery
