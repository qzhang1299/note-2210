**Liberalism** is a [political](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Political_philosophy "Political philosophy") and [moral philosophy](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Moral_philosophy "Moral philosophy") based on the [rights of the individual](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Individual_rights "Individual rights"), [liberty](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberty "Liberty"), [consent of the governed](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Consent_of_the_governed "Consent of the governed") and [equality before the law](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Equality_before_the_law "Equality before the law"). Liberals espouse a wide array of views depending on their understanding of these principles, but they generally support individual rights (including [civil rights](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Civil_rights "Civil rights") and [human rights](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Human_rights "Human rights")), [liberal democracy](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy"), [secularism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Secularism "Secularism"), [rule of law](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Rule_of_law "Rule of law"), [economic](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Economic_freedom "Economic freedom") and [political freedom](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Political_freedom "Political freedom"), [freedom of speech](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech"), [freedom of the press](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Freedom_of_the_press "Freedom of the press"), [freedom of religion](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Freedom_of_religion "Freedom of religion"), [private property](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Private_property "Private property") and a [market economy](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Market_economy "Market economy").

Liberalism became a distinct [movement](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Political_movement "Political movement") in the [Age of Enlightenment](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Age_of_Enlightenment "Age of Enlightenment"), gaining popularity among [Western](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Western_world "Western world") philosophers and economists. Liberalism sought to replace the [norms](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Norm_(social) "Norm (social)") of [hereditary privilege](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Nobility "Nobility"), [state religion](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-State_religion "State religion"), [absolute monarchy](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Absolute_monarchy "Absolute monarchy"), the [divine right of kings](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Divine_right_of_kings "Divine right of kings") and [traditional conservatism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Traditionalist_conservatism "Traditionalist conservatism") with [representative democracy](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Representative_democracy "Representative democracy") and the [rule of law](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Rule_of_law "Rule of law"). Liberals also ended [mercantilist](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Mercantilism "Mercantilism") policies, [royal monopolies](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Legal_monopoly "Legal monopoly") and other [barriers to trade](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Trade_barrier "Trade barrier"), instead promoting free trade and marketization. Philosopher [John Locke](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-John_Locke "John Locke") is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition, based on the _[social contract](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Social_contract "Social contract")_, arguing that each man has a [natural right](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Natural_and_legal_rights "Natural and legal rights") to [life, liberty and property](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Life,_liberty_and_property "Life, liberty and property") and governments must not violate these [rights](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Rights "Rights"). While the [British liberal tradition](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Gladstonian_liberalism "Gladstonian liberalism") has emphasized expanding democracy, [French liberalism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_and_radicalism_in_France "Liberalism and radicalism in France") has emphasized rejecting [authoritarianism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Authoritarianism "Authoritarianism") and is linked to [nation-building](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Nationalism "Nationalism").

Leaders in the British [Glorious Revolution](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Glorious_Revolution "Glorious Revolution") of 1688, the [American Revolution](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-American_Revolution "American Revolution") of 1776 and the [French Revolution](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-French_Revolution "French Revolution") of 1789 used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of royal [sovereignty](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Sovereignty "Sovereignty"). Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across [Europe](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_in_Europe "Liberalism in Europe") and [South America](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_and_conservatism_in_Latin_America "Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America"), whereas it was well-established alongside [republicanism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Republicanism_in_the_United_States "Republicanism in the United States") in the [United States](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_in_the_United_States "Liberalism in the United States"). In [Victorian Britain](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Victorian_Britain "Victorian Britain"), it was used to critique the political establishment, appealing to science and reason on behalf of the people. During 19th and early 20th century, [liberalism in the Ottoman Empire](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_in_Turkey "Liberalism in Turkey") and Middle East influenced periods of reform such as the [Tanzimat](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Tanzimat "Tanzimat") and [Al-Nahda](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Al-Nahda "Al-Nahda") as well as the rise of [constitutionalism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Constitutionalism "Constitutionalism"), [nationalism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Nationalism "Nationalism") and secularism. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within [Islam](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Islam "Islam"), which continues to this day, leading to [Islamic revivalism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Islamic_revivalism "Islamic revivalism"). Before 1920, the main ideological opponents of liberalism were [communism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Communism "Communism"), [conservatism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Conservatism "Conservatism") and [socialism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Socialism "Socialism"), but liberalism then faced major ideological challenges from [fascism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Fascism "Fascism") and [Marxism–Leninism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism "Marxism–Leninism") as new opponents. During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread even further, especially in Western Europe, as [liberal democracies](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberal_democracy "Liberal democracy") found themselves as the winners in both world wars.

In Europe and North America, the establishment of [social liberalism](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Social_liberalism "Social liberalism") (often called simply [_liberalism_](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Modern_liberalism_in_the_United_States "Modern liberalism in the United States") in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [welfare state](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Welfare_state "Welfare state"). Today, [liberal parties](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberal_Party "Liberal Party") continue to wield power and influence [throughout the world](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Liberalism_by_country "Liberalism by country"). The fundamental elements of [contemporary society](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Modernity "Modernity") have liberal roots. The early waves of liberalism popularised economic individualism while expanding [constitutional](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Constitution "Constitution") [government](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Government "Government") and [parliamentary](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Parliament "Parliament") authority. Liberals sought and established a constitutional order that prized important [individual freedoms](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Civil_liberties "Civil liberties"), such as [freedom of speech](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Freedom_of_speech "Freedom of speech") and [freedom of association](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Freedom_of_association "Freedom of association"); an [independent judiciary](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Independence_of_the_judiciary "Independence of the judiciary") and public [trial by jury](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Jury_trial "Jury trial"); and the abolition of [aristocratic](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Aristocracy_(class) "Aristocracy (class)") privileges. Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand civil rights. Liberals have [advocated](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Advocacy "Advocacy") gender and racial equality in their drive to promote civil rights and a [global civil rights movement](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Civil_rights_movements "Civil rights movements") in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards both goals. Other goals often accepted by liberals include [universal suffrage](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Universal_suffrage "Universal suffrage") and [universal access to education](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Universal_access_to_education "Universal access to education").
