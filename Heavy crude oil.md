**Heavy crude oil** (or **extra heavy crude oil**) is highly-viscous oil that cannot easily flow from production wells under normal reservoir conditions.

It is referred to as "heavy" because its [density](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Density "Density") or [specific gravity](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Specific_gravity "Specific gravity") is higher than that of [light crude oil](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Light_crude_oil "Light crude oil"). Heavy crude oil has been defined as any liquid petroleum with an [API gravity](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-API_gravity "API gravity") less than 20°. Physical properties that differ between heavy crude oils and lighter grades include higher [viscosity](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Viscosity "Viscosity") and specific gravity, as well as higher molecular weight hydrocarbon composition. In 2010, the [World Energy Council](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-World_Energy_Council "World Energy Council") defined extra heavy oil as crude oil having a gravity of less than 10° and a reservoir viscosity of more than 10,000 centipoises. When reservoir viscosity measurements are not available, extra-heavy oil is considered by the WEC to have a lower limit of 4° API. In other words, oil with a density greater than 1000 kg/m3 (or a specific gravity greater than 1) and a reservoir viscosity of more than 10,000 [centipoises](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Poise_(unit) "Poise (unit)"). Heavy oils and asphalt are [dense nonaqueous phase liquids](https://www.detailedpedia.com/wiki-Dense_non-aqueous_phase_liquid "Dense non-aqueous phase liquid") (DNAPLs). They have a low solubility and a viscosity greater than, and density higher than, water. Large spills of DNAPL will quickly penetrate the full depth of the aquifer and accumulate at the bottom.
