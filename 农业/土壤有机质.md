### Soil organic matter

[Soil organic matter](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/earth-and-planetary-sciences/soil-organic-matter "Learn more about Soil Organic Matter from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") (SOM) typically comprises just 1%–5% of the soil mass but plays a critical role in soil health because it exerts a strong effect on [soil properties](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/soil-properties "Learn more about soil properties from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and function. SOM is the largest terrestrial reservoir of organic C, a large storehouse for all essential nutrients, and an important factor contributing to aggregate formation and stability. As a result, SOM also regulates soil trafficability, as well as hydrologic functions, with increases in SOM reducing [infiltration](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/agricultural-and-biological-sciences/infiltration "Learn more about infiltration from ScienceDirect's AI-generated Topic Pages") and runoff rates, and enhancing flood control (Miller and Jastrow, 1990; Brady and Weil, 2002; Franzluebbers, 2002; Chenu et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2017).

Soil organic matter contains nearly all soil N and in most soils generates the majority of CEC. Furthermore, SOM can bind toxic compounds, such as Al, thereby reducing soil toxicity with benefits to plants. Thus, soils with high SOM content, on the whole, are more fertile than low SOM soils, and provide a wider range of positive benefits to plants including an enhanced rooting environment and improved soil moisture (Oldfield et al., 2017). Even low pH soils with high SOM content can provide adequate levels of N, P, and other nutrients (Perakis et al., 2013). Overall, SOM integrates multiple physical, chemical, and biological functions that support robust, resilient, and productive forests.
